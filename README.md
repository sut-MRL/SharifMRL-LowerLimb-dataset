sEMG and 3D kinematics dataset for lower limb muscles during treadmill walking
# Dataset Datasheet: sEMG and 3D Kinematics Data for Lower Limb Muscles

## Overview
This dataset contains synchronized sEMG recordings and 3D kinematics data of lower limb muscles collected during treadmill walking trials. The data is provided to support research in biomechanics and related fields.

## Data Description
- **sEMG Data:** Recorded from 11 muscles:
  - Bicep Femoris
  - Vastus Medialis
  - Gluteus Medius
  - Right External Oblique
  - Semitendinosus
  - Gracilis
  - Rectus Femoris
  - Vastus Lateralis
  - Soleus
  - Tibialis Anterior
  - Gastrocnemius Medialis
- **Kinematics Data:** 3D joint angles captured using Vicon cameras and markers attached to the ankle, knee, and hip joints.

## Equipment and Sensors
- **sEMG Sensors:** Wireless sensors used to collect muscle activity at a sampling frequency of **1000 Hz**.
- **Motion Capture:** Vicon cameras used to record joint kinematics at a frequency of **100 Hz**.

## Experimental Protocol
- **Participant Details:**
  - **Age:** 28 years
  - **Weight:** 86 kg
  - **Height:** 182 cm
- **Trial Conditions:**
  - **Walking Speeds:** Trials were conducted at 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, and 4.8 km/h.
  - **Foot Conditions:** Each speed was tested under two conditions:
    1. No additional weight on the foot.
    2. A 1.2 kg weight attached to the foot.
  - **Trial Duration:** Each of the 8 trials lasted for at least 30 seconds.

## Data Collection Process
The participant performed treadmill walking under controlled conditions. During the trials:
- sEMG signals were recorded wirelessly to monitor muscle activity.
- Simultaneously, 3D kinematics data were captured using Vicon cameras tracking markers on the joints.
- This synchronization enabled a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between muscle activation and joint movement.
